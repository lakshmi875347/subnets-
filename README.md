**ERC20 and Vault Contracts**

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for ERC20 tokens and a Vault contract. These contracts are designed to facilitate token transfers and provide a secure storage solution for managing assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

### ERC20 Contract

The ERC20 contract is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines methods that enable token transfers, as well as functionalities for querying token balances and allowances.

#### Features:

1. **Transfer**: Allows users to transfer tokens from their own address to another address.
2. **Approve/Allowance**: Enables token holders to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf and to check the amount of tokens approved for spending.
3. **TransferFrom**: Allows approved addresses to transfer tokens on behalf of token holders.
4. **BalanceOf**: Retrieves the token balance of a specified address.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract provides a secure storage solution for managing assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It enhances security by implementing access control mechanisms and enforcing customizable rules for asset management.

#### Features:

1. **Deposit**: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault.
2. **Withdraw**: Enables users to withdraw ERC20 tokens from the vault, subject to specified conditions and access control.
3. **Transfer**: Facilitates transferring tokens from the vault to specified addresses.
4. **Access Control**: Implements role-based access control to restrict operations to authorized addresses only.
5. **Customizable Rules**: Supports customizable rules for withdrawal limits, time locks, and other conditions.
### Testing

Comprehensive unit tests are provided for both the ERC20 and Vault contracts to ensure their functionality and security. You can run these tests using Truffle or a similar testing framework to validate the behavior of the contracts under various scenarios.

### Security Considerations

While these contracts aim to provide secure and reliable functionality, it's essential to conduct thorough testing and security audits before deploying them to a production environment. Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place and that the contracts adhere to best practices for smart contract development.
